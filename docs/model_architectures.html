<p>The model architectures included come from a wide variety of sources. Sources, including papers, original impl ("reference code") that <a href="https://twitter.com/wightmanr">Ross</a> rewrote / adapted, and PyTorch impl that he leveraged directly ("code") are listed below.</p>
<p>Most included models have pretrained weights. The weights are either:</p>
<ol>
<li>from their original sources</li>
<li>ported by myself from their original impl in a different framework (e.g. Tensorflow models)</li>
<li>trained from scratch using the included training script</li>
</ol>
<p>The validation results for the pretrained weights can be found <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/timm/results">here</a>.</p>
